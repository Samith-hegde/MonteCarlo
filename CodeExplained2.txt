Question 4.24

The function count() uses the rand() function to generate random coordinates. Dividing it by RAND_MAX() makes all the generated random numbers to be between 0 and 1.
If the distance of point from the origin < 1, the variable totalpts increments.

In the main function, srand(time(NULL)) is used to create a seed for random numbers to be generated. 
pthread_t thread creates a variable to store the value of thread identifier. 
At this moment, no value is assigned to the variable.

Then the program takes user input for the number of points to be generated.

pthread_create() creates a new thread in the function that is passed an argument to it (the count() function). 
'thread' is passed as the argument which stores the thread identifier.
Then NULL is passed as second attribute to set attributes of new thread created to default (attributes can be scheduling information, stack size, etc). 
count() function is third attribute, where the child thread will start running. The fourth attribute is NULL, because no integer parameter was provided on the command line.
Once pthread_create() runs, the new thread runs inside count(). 
The count() function calculates the number of random points generated that fall inside the circle of radius 1. The value n is the total number of points in the square.
pthread_join() waits for the child thread to finish executing and update data. It makes the parent thread wait. 
NULL is passed as second attribute because no return value from the child thread is expected.
Then the approximate value of pi is obtained from the given calculations.
